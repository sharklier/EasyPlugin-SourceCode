Hello! Welcome to my first plugin! Thank you for installing and using it! I was scrolling through the DevForum one day and saw someone's idea saying "There should be a plugin that makes a plugin!" 
Well, Here we are! This makes plugins from the UI you made! All you need is the UI to be controlled from a server script! Plugins don't run on local scripts which prevents click detection.
This plugin creates values for the saved data characteristics of your plugin options. Not only that it's extremely fast when creating it as a plugin! 
Just select the UI Main Frame and enter your desired characteristics and press the "Create" button! Thats all. You have the plugin.
Thank you for using and reading have a great time! -- Sharklier
