Hello! Welcome to my first plugin! Thank you for installing and using! I was scrolling on the Dev Forums one day and saw someones idea saying "There should be a plugin that makes a plugin!" 
Well, Here we are! This makes plugins froom the UI you made! ALl you need is the UI to be controlled from a ServerScript! Plugins dont run on local scripts it prevents the click detection.
This plugin creats values for the saved data characteristics of your plugin options. Not only that its extremely fast when creating it as a plugin! 
Just select the UI Main Frame and enter your desired characteristics and press the "Create" button! Thats all. You have yourself the plugin.
Thank you for using and reading have a great time! -- sharklier
